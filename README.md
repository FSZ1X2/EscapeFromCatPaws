Main features:
- A 2D game: This game will allow users to control a ball of yarn and secure it without being destroyed by cat paws. When the game starts, cat paws will randomly appear on the screen toward random directions and users need to control the ball of yarn to avoid those paws. Every time the ball hits a cat paw it will lose some yarns and when it becomes empty, game over. The game can always continue as long as the ball is ‘alive’.
